# Diffie-Hellman
Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange (DH)[nb 1] is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel and 
was one of the first public-key protocols as originally conceptualized by Ralph Merkle and named after Whitfield Diffie 
and Martin Hellman.[1][2] DH is one of the earliest practical examples of public key exchange implemented within the field of cryptography.
# Project Description
This repository is an implementation of key exchange algorithm-Diffie Hellman in Symmetric Cryptosystem.
The implemented code will generate symmetric key on both the ends for further secure message transmission.
# Requirement
Python IDE to run the code ex:IDLE
# Running the code
The above repository includes 2 files UserA.py, UserB.py.
# Steps:
1-run the UserA.py either on cmd (if path variable has been set) or on IDLE
2-open another cmd to run UserB.py similar to UserA.py
3-This will generate symmetric key on both the ends for further secure message transmission.
